            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I'm currently researching under Dr. Olivier Hervet to improve
            <a href="https://github.com/Ohervet/Bjet_MCMC"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bjet_MCMC</a> 
            because I'm interested in working with computationally
            demanding programs, and I think his work modeling Active Galactic
            Nuclei is really fascinating. I'm really excited to be able to 
            contribute to the project.
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I've been using the <a
                href="https://hummingbird.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" 
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Hummingbird Computer Cluster</a> to test 
            <em>Bjet</em> and gather data on its performance. I've
            written a bunch of python to automate tasks such as extracting and
            interpreting <em>Bjet's</em> output and creating graphs. I've also
            modified the code base to expose previously hidden 
            details about the proccess for more insight into <em>Bjet's</em>
            in-practice performance. I then took my results, prepared a 
            presentation, and shared my findings with the UCSC Very High Energy
            Astrophysics Department. I was able to find parameters that reduced
            runtime by ~20% without impacting accuracy.<br><br>My next task
            is to build a program that can automatically gather data from
            many different telescopes. The goal is to be able to anticipate
            blazar flares so that we can point a telescope at the source and
            capture the event which only occurs ~1 time per year.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            The most important thing I'm learning right now is how to deal with
            a large, complex project, that I didn't write myself. Most of my
            programming at school is individual and small scale, so working to
            augment and improve an existing codebase is a new experience. I've
            also gotten to practice larger scale software developement, and I
            have been solving different problems then I usually do,
            like deciding how I am going to organize and structure my code.
            <br><br> 
            The biggest challenge I am currently facing is that my code is 
            actually important. If it fails for some reason and we miss a 
            flare, we might have to wait years for another oppurtunity. I am 
            not sure how I am going to deal with that 100% yet, but so far I
            am taking care to think about possible errors and how I will handle 
            them. I also am working on writing unit tests for the more 
            complicated parts of my program, and I am planning to develop a 
            debugging mode that will help me run end to end tests.
