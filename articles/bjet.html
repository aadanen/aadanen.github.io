            TLDR: I contributed to a decently sized open source project by 
            adding features, testing computational optimizations, and writing
            documentation.
            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I undertook a second term of research under Dr. Olivier Hervet to 
            improve
            <a href="https://github.com/Ohervet/Bjet_MCMC"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bjet_MCMC</a> 
            and to get experience contributing to open source software, testing
            and optimizing software, and working with an OpenHPC cluster.
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I used the <a
                href="https://hummingbird.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" 
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Hummingbird Computer Cluster</a> to test 
            Bjet and gather data on its performance. I constructed a testing 
            framework in python that automates parsing Bjet's output, 
            processing the data, and visualizes it with Matplotlib. I've also
            modified the code base to expose previously hidden 
            details about the MCMC proccess for more insight into Bjet's
            in-practice performance. I then took my results, prepared a 
            presentation, and shared my findings with the UCSC Very High Energy
            Astrophysics Department. I was able to find parameters that reduced
            runtime by ~20% without impacting accuracy. I wrote documentation
            so that users can practically benefit from this work.<br><br>

            I also contributed a new feature to Bjet_MCMC. I modified existing
            code to analyze the Markov Chains' convergence. I fit an 
            exponential decay curve to the convergence and added that information 
            to the text of the output report as well as the relevant graphical
            outputs.
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            The most important thing I learned was how to deal with
            a large, complex project, that I didn't write myself. Most of my
            programming at school is individual and small scale, so working to
            augment and improve an existing codebase was a new experience. 
            <br><br>
            I also got to practice larger scale software developement. This was
            important to me because I rarely get to think about software 
            architecture or system design.
            This is because I wasn't just making a few graphs, but building
            out testing infrastructure. Bjet was not designed to be testable in
            this way so I had to parse a lot of text files to get the data. By
            making a few good abstractions and picking good data structures I
            was able to create software that could be easily be extended to 
            measure and deal with new parameters or data sources.
