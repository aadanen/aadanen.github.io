            TLDR: I contributed to a decently sized open source project by 
            adding features, testing computational optimizations, and writing
            documentation.
            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I'm currently researching under Dr. Olivier Hervet to improve
            <a href="https://github.com/Ohervet/Bjet_MCMC"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bjet_MCMC</a> 
            because I'm interested in working with computationally
            demanding programs, and I think his work modeling Active Galactic
            Nuclei is really fascinating. I'm really excited to be able to 
            contribute to the project.
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I've been using the <a
                href="https://hummingbird.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" 
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Hummingbird Computer Cluster</a> to test 
            Bjet and gather data on its performance. I've
            written a bunch of python to automate tasks such as extracting and
            interpreting Bjet's output and creating graphs. I've also
            modified the code base to expose previously hidden 
            details about the proccess for more insight into Bjet's
            in-practice performance. I then took my results, prepared a 
            presentation, and shared my findings with the UCSC Very High Energy
            Astrophysics Department. I was able to find parameters that reduced
            runtime by ~20% without impacting accuracy.<br><br>

            I continue to contribute to the Bjet repository on github. I 
            recently added a feature that fits an exponential decay curve to
            the convergence of the MCMC process. I also am adding my findings
            about Bjet's performance to the documentation.
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            The most important thing I'm learning right now is how to deal with
            a large, complex project, that I didn't write myself. Most of my
            programming at school is individual and small scale, so working to
            augment and improve an existing codebase is a new experience. 
            <br><br>
            I've
            also gotten to practice larger scale software developement, and I
            have been solving different problems then I usually do,
            like deciding how I am going to organize and structure my code. 
            This is because I wasn't just making a few graphs, but building
            out testing infrastructure. Bjet was not designed to be testable in
            this way so I had to parse a lot of text files to get the data. By
            making a few good abstractions I was able to keep my code readable
            and extensible.
