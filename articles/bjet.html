            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I'm currently researching under Dr. Olivier Hervet to improve
            <a href="https://github.com/Ohervet/Bjet_MCMC"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bjet_MCMC</a> 
            because I'm interested in working with computationally
            demanding programs. Also, I think the scientific environment is
            really exciting because I liked to work on projects that are pushing
            boundaries and demand the highest quality software.
            
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I've been using the <a
                href="https://hummingbird.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" 
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Hummingbird Computer Cluster</a> to test 
            <em>Bjet</em> and gather data. I've
            written a bunch of python to automate tasks such as extracting and
            interpreting <em>Bjet's</em> output and creating graphs. I've also
            modified existing python code to expose previously hidden 
            details about the proccess. I then took my results, prepared a 
            presentation, and shared my findings with the UCSC Very High Energy
            Astrophysics Department. I was able to find parameters that reduced
            runtime by ~20% without impacting accuracy.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            The most important thing I'm learning right now is how to deal with
            a large, complex project, that I didn't write myself. Most of my
            programming at school is individual and small scale, so working to
            augment and improve an existing codebase is a new experience. I've
            also gotten to practice larger scale software developement, and I
            have been solving different problems then I usually do,
            like deciding how I am going to organize and structure my code.
