            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I'm currently researching under Dr. Olivier Hervet to improve
            <a>Bjet_MCMC</a> 
            because I'm interested in working with computationally
            demanding programs, and I think Astrophysics as well as many other
            physical sciences are a really interesting place to apply computer
            science. It's exciting for me to work on projects that are pushing
            the boundaries and demand the highest quality of work.
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I've been using the <a>Hummingbird Computer Cluster</a> to test 
            <em>Bjet</em> and gather data for the experiment I designed. I've
            written a bunch of python to automate tasks such as extracting and
            interpreting <em>Bjet's</em> output and creating graphs. I've also
            modified existing python code to expose previously hidden 
            details about the proccess. I then took my results, prepared a 
            presentation, and shared my findings with the UCSC Very High Energy
            Astrophysics Department.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            The most important thing I'm currently learning is how to deal with
            a large, complex project, that I didn't write myself. Most of my
            programming at school is individual and small scale, so working to
            augment and improve an existing codebase is a fun experience. I've
            also gotten to practice larger scale software developement, and I
            have been solving problems like deciding how I am going to organize
            my code.
