            TLDR: If my code fails to detect a rare astrophysical event, we 
            will have to wait ~1-2 years for another chance, and Dr. Hervet 
            misses out on a $98,000 grant.
            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            Blazars flare only once every year or two. By constantly monitoring
            the energy output, we can anticipate one of these rare events. By 
            catching a flare early, Dr. Hervet can trigger a Target of 
            Opportunity request to several telescopes to set aside all other 
            observations and immediately focus on Mrk421. This focus 
            would gather in depth data on Blazar behavior during a flare, 
            which currently doesn't exist. 
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I wrote a python script that gathers data from 3 different 
            telescopes: <a href="https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/" 
                           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              VERITAS</a>, 
                      <a 
                href="https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/about_swift/xrt_desc.html" 
                           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        SWIFT-XRT</a>, and 
                      <a href="http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.html" 
                           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        MAXI-RIKEN</a>.
              Then, it analyzes the data to detect if a flare is about
            to occur, and if a flare is detected, it composes and sends an alert
            email.
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            The biggest challenge I am currently facing is that my code is 
            actually important. If it fails for some reason and we miss a 
            flare, we might have to wait years for another oppurtunity. I dealt
            with this in several ways. Throughout the project, I sought to keep
            my code and simple as possible, to minimize errors. In all stages of
            the program, I focused on error handling, and in the event of a 
            fatal error I send an emergency email. I also have been personally
            monitoring the output every day, even if a flare isn't detected,
            but thats mostly because its kinda neat to see what Mrk421 is doing.
            It also takes barely any time because I get an email summary every
            day.
