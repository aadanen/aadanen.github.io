            TLDR: automatic data analysis pipeline for the VERITAS observatory
            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            After my Junior year of highschool, I wanted to continue to explore
            computer science. After hearing about the
            Science Internship Program at UC Santa Cruz, I thought it would be
            a really exciting opportunity.            
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            During the 8 week program, I collaborated with 2 other interns to
            build a data visualization application. To accomplish this, I 
            taught myself how to program, how to use technologies such as ssh
            and the linux shell, and started learning how to move and 
            manipulate data. After 8 weeks, I had >10 python scripts that
            basically were just functions. I moved data between the scripts
            (that were basically functions) by writing and the reading from 
            .csv files. While it technically worked, it was horribly slow,
            buggy, untestable, and a total pain to modify or improve. I was
            unsatisfied with my part of the project, and so I kept at it for 
            the rest of the summer and the start of my senior year, basically
            re-writing the whole thing. I took advantage of functions, the
            pandas library, and of my past experience to build a new pipeline
            thats fairly robust, easy to modify, and orders of magnitude more
            efficient. 
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            It was during this time that I learned how to develop software
            and work with computers at a basic level. I also became very
            self sufficient, and I found that no programming problem stands
            a chance against patience and determination. I learned how to teach
            myself complex topics, and how to solve problems that initially
            seem impossible. These skills are fundamental to who I am as a 
            programmer today, and are some of my greatest strengths.
