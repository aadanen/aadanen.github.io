            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I wanted to explore web development as a genre of software 
            development. I also understood that having a portfolio website 
            would be beneficial for trying to break into the job market. 
            However, a lot of my design choices were made to target the tech 
            stack of a local internship opportunity.
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            I built a pseudo corporate website that was nicely designed, 
            performant, and had some unique features like hosting a WebGL 
            version of a game I made in Unity. I accomplished my primary goal,
            of having a website which I could update over time and display my 
            projects and experiences in more depth than I can squeeze on to a 
            resume. 
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            I taught myself CSS, HTML, ASP.NET, AWS, IIS, Postgres, and several
            other pieces of software. I learned how to do all the necessary 
            cyber plumbing to
            connect all the pieces together. I also developed a basic 
            understanding of how a website really works. However, 
            the most important 
            lesson was the importance of choosing the right tool for the job.
            My failure to do that meant, my site was over-complicated, expensive,
            and took much longer to develop than it could have.
