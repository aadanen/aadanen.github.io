            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            I wanted to learn about embedded programming and convince my 
            roomate to let me turn on the AC.
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            Starting with zero knowledge, I started by researching components. 
            I had to:<br>
            1. Measure the temperature in my room<br>
            2. Digitally process the signal from the sensor<br>
            3. Display the results<br>
            After looking online, I decided to purchase an Adafruit Feather
            M0 Wifi microcontroller. This board only cost me $10 and was very
            versatile, even though somewhat overkill for my project. One reason
            I picked it was that it would interface easily with my chosen 
            screen and temperature sensor. Its I2C data and clock pins were 
            easily accessible, and I only had to use a couple of pull-up 
            resistors to tie in my AM2320 digital temperature sensor. To 
            display the measurements, I wrote some custom "firmware" to read
            data from the sensor and print text to a screen that was designed 
            to stack on top of my microcontroller. Overall, this project was
            pretty much my "Hello World" when it comes to embedded programming.
            It mirrors the classic project not only in its simplicity, but with
            how tons of stuff happened under the hood that I don't understand
            yet.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            I learned how to research components and read pinout diagrams and
            spec sheets and then synthesize that knowledge with my 
            understanding of digital and analog circuits to create a complete
            device. I also learned to use ArduinoIDE, although that software
            is designed to be very beginner friendly. Overall I had a lot of
            fun and the most important thing I learned is that I'm interested
            in learning more about embedded programming!
