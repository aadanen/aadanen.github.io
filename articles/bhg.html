            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            My friends and I always talked about making our own video game, so
            once we somewhat knew how to program, we decided to give it a shot. 
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            Me and one other friend collaborated to use Unity to make a 
            simple game. We made a 2D bullet hell with custom sprites, music, 
            and a (hopefully) exciting gameplay loop.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            I got much better at programming in general. My previous experience
            was just my highschool "Introduction to Computer Science" course
            so it was in this project where I learned about problems that are 
            bigger than a single function and got my first taste of software
            development. I also started thinking about video game development
            as more than a natural progression of "I like playing video games."
            Today, I see game development as a really exciting intersection
            between physics, computer science, computer graphics, and art.
