            TLDR: I made an automatic analysis pipeline for the NICER 
            instrument on the ISS.
            <h3>Why did I do it?</h3>
            The Bjetwatcher project required daily updates from NICER, but 
            there was no existing automatic analysis pipeline. I also already
            had experience making this sort of product, so I was the right 
            person for the job. 
            <h3>What did I accomplish?</h3>
            The first step of the process is to check if there were any new 
            observations. I maintain a record of the data that I already have,
            which includes its observation ID, runtime, mission start time, and
            other datapoints. I then query NICER's master database, and compare 
            it with my local data to see if there is anything new.<br><br>

            In the case theres a new observation, it needs to be analyzed. I 
            use the python subproccess library to run the two preproccessing 
            programs which are provided by the NICER team. Next, I need to
            perform spectral analysis using the XSPEC tool. Usually, this is 
            where an astrophysicist would step in and use their experience
            analyze the data by hand. This is still required if you need top
            quality analysis, but I was able to write a bash script that mocks
            up the inputs for a basic analysis.<br><br>

            I then take the raw
            data points out of XSPEC to reimplement the post proccessing steps
            create my own graphics with Matplotlib. I perform unit conversions,
            rebinning operations, and run an error propogation simulation in
            order to generate detailed, informative, and beautiful visualizations.

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            While working with XSPEC, I originally assumed I could perform 
            the post processing operations inside of XSPEC and then extract 
            those datapoints and only run the error propogation sim. In order
            to accomplish this, I depended not only on XSPEC but also on the 
            work NICER has done to implement their background model within 
            XSPEC. While trying to figure out some issues with my plots, I
            discovered what appeared to be a bug within XSPEC. It turned out
            that NICER's background model had an undocumented interaction with
            XSPEC that makes one of its fundamental operations "nonphysical" 
            according to the NICER help desk. I learned a valuable lesson about
            trusting that software works and the dangers of taking a black-box
            approach to a fundamental piece of a project. I am unsure if I 
            could have avoided this problem if I had stronger fundamentals in
            astrophysics and statistics, or if it was just a landmine edge case that
            didn't make it into the documentation.
