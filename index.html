    Hello! My name is Aaron and I'm a software developer. 
    I am currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science
    and Engineering at the University of California, Davis.

        I am currently working under<a 
   href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-hervet-75113852/">
        Dr. Olivier Heret</a> to test, model, and optimize the performance of 
    his statistical modeling software for Blazars, 
    <a href="https://github.com/Ohervet/Bjet_MCMC">Bjet_MCMC</a>. 
    I'm using Python and UCSC's new <a href="https://hummingbird.ucsc.edu/">
        "Hummingbird" computational cluster</a> to optimize <em>Bjet's</em> 
    input parameters to minimize reasource requirements and maximize ouput 
    accuracy. I will define <em>Bjet's</em> default parameters and provide
    users with guidelines on how to tune <em>Bjet</em> to their use case.

    My original portfolio website. I used Microsoft's 
    <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a> and 
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
    to build a website displaying my projects. I hosted the site myself with
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.iis.net/">IIS</a>. 
    I even used 
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> 
    to keep track of my data (3 projects).
    The project was a great success because I learned so much. The project
    was doomed from the start because the tech stack wasn't informed by the
    needs of the application but the requirements of an intership I was 
    targeting. I also learned the hard way why its important to consistently
    push code to github and the dangers of keeping no backups of my EC2 private
    key.

    A complete data science pipeline. I used 
    <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and 
    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a>
     to gather data
    that was recorded by the <a href="https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/">
    VERITAS</a> telescope. Then, I automated the data-proccesing, analysis,
    and visualization process in order to save scientists time and reduce 
    compute load. The program runs nightly in order to supply a website with
    the most recent possible data gathered from 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markarian_421">Markarian 421.</a>

    <p class="mini_title"><em>Bullet Hell</em>: December 2022</p>

    A simple retro style game. I used
    <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a>
    to make an arcady top-down shooter game. I admit it isn't technically very
    impressive from a programming point of view (maybe 2 for loops) but I'm
    proud of it artistically, and my partner and I really had to perservere to
    learn Unity. It's like many industry standard tools where it's really 
    powerful, but brutal for beginners. Learning AWS was a similar experience.
